		<p>Though it may not be possible to walk on water, the Overseas Highway (U.S. 1) gives us the next best thing. As the only road connecting the Florida Keys, the 107-mile stretch of highway travels in-between islands, "floating" above the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The route starts in Key Largo and ends in Key West, passing through world-class fishing sites, historic monuments, and state and national parks.</p>
